7. Streaming pipelines via kafka - ?
8. Graph model creation (26.12) - Marilin
9. Presentation / example queries (31.12/03.01) - All peeps

## 3. Code & workflow conventions
* When doing something new create a pull request and commit there:
`git checkout -b 1-branch-name`,`git add -A`,`git commit -m "Commit message"`, `git push`
* Before commiting make sure to close your docker image, else it keeps writing to logs and blocks git commands
* No spaghetti code
* TBD
